# Project Review Criteria Template

This file defines project-specific review criteria that will be evaluated in addition to the standard review dimensions. Uncomment and modify the sections relevant to your project.

<!--
<project_context>
Describe your project's domain, purpose, and any special considerations.
For example:
- Financial services application handling payment processing
- Healthcare system processing PHI data
- E-commerce platform with high availability requirements
- Real-time messaging system with low latency requirements
</project_context>
-->

<!--
<additional_review_dimensions>
Define custom review dimensions beyond the standard security/correctness/performance checks.
Examples:

- **Accessibility**: All UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Internationalization**: All user-facing strings must use i18n functions
- **Data Privacy**: PII must never be logged or exposed in error messages
- **API Consistency**: All endpoints must follow REST conventions and return consistent error formats
- **Database Migrations**: Schema changes must include reversible migrations
</additional_review_dimensions>
-->

<!--
<critical_paths>
Identify paths in your codebase that require extra scrutiny during reviews.
Format: `path/pattern` - Description of why it's critical

Examples:
- `src/auth/**` - Authentication system (zero tolerance for vulnerabilities)
- `src/payments/**` - Payment processing (requires PCI compliance review)
- `src/api/public/**` - Public API endpoints (must have rate limiting and validation)
- `database/migrations/**` - Database schema changes (must be reversible)
- `src/crypto/**` - Cryptographic operations (must use approved algorithms)
</critical_paths>
-->

<!--
<project_standards>
Define coding standards and patterns that must be followed in this project.
Examples:

- All database queries must use parameterized statements or ORM methods
- API responses must follow the format: `{data: ..., error: ..., metadata: ...}`
- New endpoints require OpenAPI documentation in `docs/api/`
- React components must have PropTypes or TypeScript definitions
- All async functions must have proper error handling
- Configuration must be loaded from environment variables, never hardcoded
- Sensitive operations must produce audit log entries
</project_standards>
-->

<!--
<compliance_requirements>
List any compliance standards your project must meet.

## HIPAA (Healthcare)
- PHI must be encrypted at rest using AES-256
- All PHI access must be logged with user, timestamp, and reason
- PHI transmission must use TLS 1.2 or higher
- User sessions must timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

## PCI-DSS (Payments)
- Credit card numbers must never be logged
- Payment data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access to payment systems must use multi-factor authentication
- Regular security scans must pass without critical issues

## GDPR (Data Privacy)
- User consent must be obtained before data collection
- Users must be able to request data deletion
- Data portability must be supported
- Privacy policy must be updated when data usage changes
</compliance_requirements>
-->

<!--
<security_requirements>
Define specific security requirements beyond standard practices.

- **Authentication**: All endpoints except `/health` and `/metrics` require JWT authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Public endpoints must implement rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- **Input Validation**: All user input must be validated against defined schemas
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data fields must use field-level encryption
- **Secrets Management**: Secrets must be loaded from vault, never from config files
- **CORS**: Only whitelisted origins may access the API
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy must be enforced on all HTML responses
</security_requirements>
-->

<!--
<performance_requirements>
Define specific performance thresholds and requirements.

- **Response Time**: 95th percentile response time must be < 200ms
- **Database Queries**: Maximum 3 database queries per API request
- **Memory Usage**: Services must not exceed 512MB memory usage
- **Payload Size**: API responses must not exceed 1MB uncompressed
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections must use pooling with max 20 connections
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data must use Redis caching
- **Pagination**: List endpoints must implement pagination with max 100 items
</performance_requirements>
-->

<!--
<zero_tolerance_issues>
List issues that must always be treated as critical severity.
These will block PR merge regardless of other factors.

Examples:
- Hardcoded passwords or API keys in code
- Disabled authentication or authorization checks
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Unencrypted storage or transmission of sensitive data
- Use of deprecated cryptographic algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
- Logging of passwords, tokens, or credit card numbers
- CORS wildcard (*) in production configuration
- Direct execution of user input (eval, exec, system calls)
- Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
</zero_tolerance_issues>
-->

<!--
<custom_checks>
Define specific patterns to check for during review.

- **Pattern**: `console\.log`
  **Severity**: high
  **Message**: Production code must not contain console.log statements

- **Pattern**: `TODO|FIXME|HACK`
  **Severity**: medium
  **Message**: Unresolved TODOs must be addressed or ticketed before merge

- **Pattern**: `any\s*:\s*any`
  **Severity**: medium
  **Message**: TypeScript 'any' type should be avoided except in exceptional cases

- **Pattern**: `setTimeout.*[0-9]{4,}`
  **Severity**: low
  **Message**: Long timeouts (>10s) should be configurable, not hardcoded

- **Pattern**: `catch\s*\(\s*\)`
  **Severity**: high
  **Message**: Empty catch blocks hide errors and make debugging difficult
</custom_checks>
-->

## Usage

1. Copy this file to your project root as `.review-criteria.md`
2. Uncomment and modify the sections relevant to your project
3. Remove any sections you don't need
4. Commit the file to your repository

The review pipeline will automatically detect and apply these criteria during PR reviews.
