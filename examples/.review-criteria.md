# Project Review Criteria

This file defines project-specific review criteria that will be injected into all provider prompts.

<performance>
## Performance Requirements
- Database queries must use appropriate indexes
- Avoid N+1 query patterns in ORM usage
- Cache expensive computations where appropriate
- API responses should complete within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Batch operations should use bulk queries
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths
</performance>

<security>
## Security Standards
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries exclusively (no string concatenation)
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Apply principle of least privilege for all operations
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Use cryptographically secure random number generation
- Validate file uploads for type and size
- Implement CSRF protection on state-changing operations
</security>

<code-style>
## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow project naming conventions (camelCase for JS, snake_case for Python)
- Add JSDoc/docstring comments for all public APIs
- Keep functions under 50 lines of code
- Maintain cyclomatic complexity below 10
- Use descriptive variable names (minimum 3 characters)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write pure functions where possible
- Add unit tests for new functionality
</code-style>

<error-handling>
## Error Handling Requirements
- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Return meaningful error messages to users
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Use custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Ensure resources are properly cleaned up in error paths
- Validate all external API responses
</error-handling>

<testing>
## Testing Standards
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include edge cases in test scenarios
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Add integration tests for critical paths
</testing>

<documentation>
## Documentation Requirements
- Update README for new features
- Document all configuration options
- Include examples for complex APIs
- Keep inline comments concise and relevant
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG
- Add architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes
</documentation>

<dependencies>
## Dependency Management
- Justify addition of new dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained packages (recent updates, many contributors)
- Check for security vulnerabilities before adding
- Use exact versions in production dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Avoid packages with restrictive licenses
</dependencies>

<architecture>
## Architecture Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Keep business logic separate from infrastructure
- Implement proper logging and monitoring hooks
- Design for horizontal scalability
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
</architecture>
